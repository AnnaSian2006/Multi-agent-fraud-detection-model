New Features & Enhancements

On top of the existing project, we have developed and integrated the following new features:

Behavioral Biometrics Integration → Leveraging touch gestures (swipes, taps, pans, gyroscope data) for fraud detection.

Custom Flask Backend API → Provides real-time fraud prediction based on user interactions.

Next.js Frontend Dashboard → Interactive user interface for visualizing and testing fraud predictions.

Cross-platform Support → API endpoints designed to integrate with both web and mobile applications.

Enhanced Model Training → Improved preprocessing pipeline and fraud detection accuracy using behavioral datasets.
