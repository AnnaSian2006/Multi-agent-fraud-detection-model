**Fraud Detection Model using Multi-agent system**

Overview:

This project implements an AI-powered Fraud Detection System that leverages both transactional data and behavioral patterns (like keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, and mobile gestures) to identify fraudulent activities in real time.
Unlike traditional rule-based systems, this model uses machine learning agents to adapt to evolving fraud patterns, ensuring robust protection against emerging threats.

Tech Stack

Frontend:
Next.js (React + TypeScript)
Tailwind CSS / ShadCN for UI components
API integration with Flask backend

Backend:
Flask (Python REST API)
SQLite / Supabase for secure data storage
Scikit-learn / TensorFlow for ML model training

AI/ML:
Supervised learning for classification (Fraud / Non-Fraud)
Feature engineering for behavioral inputs
Explainability modules for transparency

Agents in the Model
1. Transaction Monitoring Agent

Tracks financial transactions (amount, frequency, location, time).
Detects anomalies such as unusual spending or location-based mismatches.

2. Behavioral Biometrics Agent

Analyzes user interaction patterns (swipes, taps, typing speed, cursor movement).
Flags deviations from the genuine user profile.

3. Decision Engine Agent

Aggregates predictions from multiple agents.
Assigns a fraud score and triggers alerts if it crosses a risk threshold.

4. Explainability Agent (XAI)

Provides transparent insights into why a transaction was flagged.
Helps build trust by showing critical features contributing to fraud detection.

Features

Protection against credential theft and synthetic fraud.
Cross-platform usability (web & mobile).
Scalable backend API for integration with existing systems.
Transparent reporting via explainable AI modules.

Societal Impact

Fraud is a multi-billion-dollar problem that erodes trust in digital systems. This model enhances financial security, prevents identity theft, and builds a safer digital economy by detecting fraud before damage occurs.
